                <h2>About CONVErGENCE</h2>
                <p class="prospectus"><span class="light">Sometimes I browse the ‘missed connections’ section of random craigslist cities to see if I can find some creative inspiration, or exercise my empathy for people who, for all intents and purposes, don’t exist to me.</span> <br><br>“jerking off in car - m4w (millenia mall) I didnt get a good look at you because it was raining if your interested in watching again let me know. i can meet you in any parking lot you want”(Orlando).<span class="light"> <br><br>I think, mostly, about the profound sadness that exists in this outreach for contact, any contact, any connection with humanity at large. I do this until I feel this sadness creeping into the edges of my being, and then go write something – or maybe not. <br><br>
	I want to be devastated in a sentence, and I want to devastate with a word. That’s what CONVErGENCE is all about. It’s a project that I am envisioning that captures the exceptional sadness that exists between human beings who talk, but never really communicate – Who never say a word to each other, but will think about the unspoken words that passed in a single glance, for days. It’s about the yawing abyss that exists, hidden by the blue-ish glow of a computer screen at 2 in the morning, between anonymous user A and anonymous user B, and whoever else. Fleeting glimpses at the underpinnings of a society fraying at the edges, mostly because of the invention of ‘shuffle’, and mp3’s. <br><br>
	Maybe there’s a chance though, that CONVErGENCE is, deep down, optimistic. Otherwise, I would have called it DIVErGENCE... or something (although there’s less symmetry in that, so who knows). Because really, all it takes, is a little effort to come to the realization that deep down we’re all want the same things – a real connection to another human being. All it takes is a little bit of hard work, and probably a bit of heartbreak along the way, but it’ll work itself out. We’re led astray by our ability to skip through tracks, and swipe left, and unfollow / hide / change privacy settings. Put yourself out there, and hell, who knows, you might find someone who wants to watch you masturbate in a mall parking lot. <br><br>
	CONVErGENCE, on the more technical side of things, is a digital (HAHA yes I get the irony) presentation of these ideas. I’ll be spending a block constructing a website that interacts, albeit sparingly, with the user. It’s a story that, through fragments and flashes on a computer screen, attempts to convey a generation of helplessness in a post 9-11 world. CONVErGENCE will present itself to the reader through a solely digital medium – taking in stride both the advantages and disadvantages that come along with a guideline like that. The presentation of CONVErGENCE will be a holistic approach to the artistic intent of the piece itself – going beyond a simply rearranging of grammatical structures or other tools of the English language. <br><br>
	To prep for the project, I’m going to soak up as much post-modern literature as I can find. Donald Barthelme, David Foster Wallace, Kurt Vonnegut, Vladimir Nobokov even… All have a way of eliciting emotion, and teasing a response from the reader with an unconventional style, and using minimal page space (Incarnations of Burned Children, A Long Walk to Forever, Pale Fire respectively). I’m also taking a block (block 3) to conceive and create a website that can handle these ideas, and convey them in a manner spiritually appropriate to the pillars of the project itself. <br><br>
	In CONVErGENCE, the user has a sense of control, not as a participant in the story, but as an active listener to the story that is unfolding around them. It’s not about them, but it certainly does affect them and may even be affected by them. There will be characters and stories, but nothing that is beyond ephemeral. This control exists, but is a relatively superficial one. I’m hoping to include some sound &amp; visual elements as well as text, though text will be the primary vessel for meaning. The user can leave &amp; return to find their progress saved, but cannot progress until certain things have been accomplished – reading to the end of the page, pressing a key sequence, something like that. <br><br>
	CONVErGENCE will be almost entirely devoid of traditional narrative structure. You, the reader, make connections to what’s real for your experience of the world. It’s my intention to challenge the reader to be creative, be an active participant in the reading, not simply a receptacle for text. It’s not going to necessarily easy to understand, but I don’t want to be obtusely confusing simply for the sake of it – The goal is to have intention behind everything, even if that isn’t entirely clear to the reader. <br><br>

There will be no ‘skip’ or ‘shuffle’ buttons. That is all.
